    <string name="about">A <i><b>Redâ€“black tree</b></i> is a kind of self-balancing binary search tree.Balance is preserved by painting each node of the tree with one of two colors (typically called "red" and "black") in a way that satisfies certain properties, which collectively constrain how unbalanced the tree can become in the worst case. When the tree is modified, the new tree is subsequently rearranged and repainted to restore the coloring properties.</string>
